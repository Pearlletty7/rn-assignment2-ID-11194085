# rn-assignment2-ID

   For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a new React Native blank template project using the Expo CLI. Within the App.js file of the project, I needed to make several changes. First, I changed the background color of the main View component. Next, I edited the Text component to display the text "My name is Pearl Yawa Kaatey". I then increased the font size of the text to 24 and made my name bold, so that it would appear as "My name is â€œPearl Yawa Kaatey".
